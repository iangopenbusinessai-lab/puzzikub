 * builder directly. When it is undefined — the only case a real player ever hits
 * — nothing below changes: the same Math.random() draws happen in the same order
 * as before this parameter existed, so generation odds are untouched.
 *
 * A forced variant does NOT fall back to another archetype when its builder
 * cannot produce a puzzle (e.g. the trap layers are hard/extreme only, so
 * forcing 'decoy' at easy returns null). Failing visibly is the point of a dev
 * flag — silently handing back a different variant would defeat it.
