// covering segment in a winning grid can never be all-rack (that segment would
// be a valid run/group made of rack tiles alone). So every placed rack tile
// shares a row-segment with a board tile. Ordering the placements by horizontal
// distance from the nearest board tile in that segment always yields an order in

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Construction: "groups to runs", horizontal-only edition.
//
// The board shows the dual block D(4, L) — four colours over L consecutive
// values — laid out as its L GROUPS. Under the horizontal-only rule a group has
// to BE a horizontal strip, so each value gets its own row: four tiles of the
// same value in four different colours, side by side. That is what the player
// sees at move zero, and validateGrid accepts every one of them.
//
// WHY THE RACK IS HOMELESS — the replacement for the old spacing/derangement
// argument, which reasoned about vertical column adjacency and does not survive
// the transpose. Two structural facts do all the work now:
//
//   1. ONE MAXIMAL SEGMENT PER ROW. Each board row holds exactly one contiguous
//      strip and nothing else, so there is no interior gap between two board
//      tiles in a row. The old failure — a rack tile bridging two flanking board
//      tiles into a run — cannot even be expressed here. (Rows are separated
//      vertically only for looks; vertical adjacency has no meaning any more.)
//
//   2. EVERY STRIP IS A *FULL* FOUR-COLOUR GROUP. isValidGroup caps at 4, so the
//      strip cannot grow into a bigger group; and it holds four distinct colours,
//      so it can never be part of a run. Appending ANY tile to either end of any
//      board row therefore makes that row's segment invalid — whatever the tile
//      is. This is stronger than the old guarantee, which depended on the rack's
//      values; this one holds for every conceivable rack.
//
// So the only segment a rack tile can be covered by is one built entirely out of
// rack tiles — and invariant (c) forbids exactly that. Hence (d) follows from
// (c) on these boards. That implication is asserted, not assumed: the builder
// still runs the full exhaustive existsNoRelocationWin gate below, and
// verifyEngine.ts cross-checks the gate against a planted win and an unpruned
// brute force.
//
// The rack holds the block's run extensions: tiles at value s-1 and s+L, at most
// one per colour and at most two per value — so the rack contains no run (needs
// three consecutive values in one colour; it has two non-adjacent values) and no
// group (needs three colours at one value; it has at most two).
//
// The only way out is to see the block the other way round: break the L groups
// apart and rebuild the same tiles as 4 runs, one colour per row, which the rack
// tiles then extend. Same tiles, two structures — Latin-rectangle duality, used
// as the trap rather than as the scaffold.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// minMoves — the length of the reference solution under the REAL move model.
//
// usePlayState's DROP reducer, GRID→GRID branch:
//     grid[src.row][src.col] = grid[row][col]
//     grid[row][col]         = tile
// Dropping a grid tile on an OCCUPIED cell SWAPS the two, in one move (and
// Board.tsx fires onCellEnter on occupied cells, so the player can reach it).
// A move therefore relocates one tile (target empty) or two (target occupied).
//
// Fix a goal layout: an injective map tile → cell. Draw one edge per misplaced
// board tile, from the cell it sits on to the cell it belongs on. Goal cells are
// distinct, so every cell has in-degree ≤ 1; a cell holds one tile, so
// out-degree ≤ 1. The misplaced subgraph is therefore a disjoint union of simple
// paths and simple cycles, and:
//
//   - A path of k tiles ends at an empty cell (a cell with an outgoing edge
//     holds a tile; the last one does not). Walk it backwards — tail tile into
//     the empty cell, then each tile into the cell just vacated. k moves.
//   - A cycle of k tiles never touches an empty cell. Swap c1's tile with the
//     occupant of its goal: c1's tile is now home, and the displaced tile sits
//     at c1. Repeat. After k−1 swaps the last tile has landed on c1, its own
//     goal. k−1 moves — one fewer than the k the tiles would cost apart.
//   - Rack tiles have no cell, so they have out-degree 1 and in-degree 0: each
//     heads a path and can never lie on a cycle. One move each.
//
//   cost(goal) = boardTiles + rack − fixed(goal) − cycles(goal)
//
// So minimising cost means maximising fixed + cycles, and a cycle decomposition
// gets both in one O(tiles) pass. The goal family is "one colour's run per row";
// its free parameters are which colour owns which row (a permutation of the ≤ 4
// colours) plus where the block sits, so the whole minimisation is a few hundred
// linear passes. Measured at 0.02 ms on a real extreme puzzle.
//
// This is exact for that family, which is what `optimalMoves` has always meant
// here: the length of the solution the builder can prove, an upper bound on the
// true optimum over every conceivable winning layout.

// Construction: "runs to groups" — the mirror image of the above.
//
// The board shows N=3 colours over L consecutive values, laid out as its 3 RUNS:
// one colour per row, values ascending. The hidden goal is the same tiles as L
// GROUPS: one value per row, distinct colours side by side. Same duality, walked
// the other way, so recognising one direction does not hand you the other.
//
// WHY N IS FORCED TO 3. The goal is groups, and isValidGroup caps a group at 4
// tiles of distinct colours. Every value on the board already carries N colours,
// so the rack can only add a colour a value does not have yet. With N=4 there is
// no such colour, and boundary-value rack tiles (at s-1 or s+L) could only ever
// group with each other — which invariant (c) forbids. So the board takes 3 of
// the 4 colours, and the rack is made entirely of the 4th.
//
// WHY THE RACK IS HOMELESS — the mirror of the group-board argument:
//
//   1. ONE MAXIMAL SEGMENT PER ROW. Each board row is one gapless run and
//      nothing else, so no rack tile can bridge two flanking board tiles.
//
//   2. EVERY STRIP IS A RUN IN A COLOUR THE RACK DOES NOT HAVE. Append a rack
//      tile to either end of any board row and that row's segment holds two
//      colours — so it is not a run — while its values stay distinct — so it is
//      not a group. Whatever the tile is, the row breaks. Note this is why the
//      rack's colour must be off-board: a rack tile at s-1 or s+L in a board
//      colour would simply extend that run, which is failure mode 1 exactly.
//
// So a rack tile can only be covered by an all-rack segment. The rack is one
// colour, so such a segment is never a group, and it is a run only if it holds
// 3 consecutive values — which the value picker below refuses to produce. Hence
// (d) follows from (c) here too, and as before the implication is asserted, not
// assumed: the exhaustive existsNoRelocationWin gate still runs on every board.
//
// The only way out is to break the 3 runs apart and rebuild the same tiles as L
// groups, one value per row, which the rack's 4th colour then completes.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *
 * Consequence: L=8 (~5s/build) was tried for extreme to chase a higher par
 * but reverted — the 10x generation-time cost wasn't worth the calibration
 * gain over L=7 (~0.5s/build, same as hard). Every tier now stays at L<=7.
 * This trade was an explicit, discussed choice — see CLAUDE.md session notes
 * — not an oversight. rackSize is chosen at each L to land par as close to

//     Lo = {s-1, c}  (visibly extends c's run at the bottom)

// Both score as obvious run-extensions (OBVIOUS ×2), so the player faces a real
// discrimination task, not a single thing to be suspicious of.
//
// THE INTERACTION (this is what makes it a red herring, not two glued decoys):
// both extenders' true homes come from the SAME hybrid reorganization — c splits
// into a LOW short run {s-1,s,s+1} and a HIGH short run {s+L-2,s+L-1,s+L}, its
// middle values stay as {c, o1, o2} groups, and the four vacated end-values
// (s, s+1, s+L-2, s+L-1) become {o1, o2, kColour} groups (the four kColour
// "supports"). Committing EITHER extender to its obvious append makes c one
// contiguous block again, which destroys the OTHER extender's short-run home:
// the other extender is orphaned and the remainder is UNSOLVABLE. So getting one
// wrong provably makes the other's true home unreachable — the two tiles are
// coupled through one reorganization, and neither obvious move is safe.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// COMPOSED archetype — decoy AND red herring on ONE board, different colours.
//
// The goal is a multi-step deductive chain: the player must resolve a one-ended
// trap on colour cD *and* a two-ended trap on colour cH to win. Neither mechanic
// in isolation, and not two independent puzzles side by side — see the coupling
// note below.
//
// WHY THE NAIVE SUPERPOSITION IS IMPOSSIBLE (probed with real solveBag before
// building, not assumed). Simply putting buildDecoy's rack on colour cD and
// buildRedHerring's rack on colour cH fails twice over:
//
//   1. TILE COLLISION. decoy wants kColour supports at {s+L-2, s+L-1}; red
//      herring wants them at {s, s+1, s+L-2, s+L-1}. The 4th colour has exactly
//      ONE tile per value, so the two demands collide on 2 tiles at every L.
//   2. The deeper, unfixable-by-retuning wall — GROUP BUDGET. Both modifiers'
//      high traps end in a short run containing s+L, and *any* valid run
//      containing s+L also contains s+L-1 and s+L-2. So both cD and cH vacate
//      those two values, leaving only {third board colour, kColour} = 2 colours
//      there — below isValidGroup's minimum of 3. No choice of value range or
//      grid size repairs this, because it is forced by run contiguity.
//
// THE FIX — make the high end a RUN-ONLY ZONE. Rather than fight for a group at
// s+L-2 / s+L-1, the layout gives up on having one: the third board colour cC
// also runs across the high end, so all three board colours are in runs there
// and no group is needed at all. kColour simply carries no tile at those values.
//
//   board  : three colour runs at s..s+L-1 (a runs-to-groups board)
//   rack   : D  = {s+L, cD}          one-ended  decoy   (extends cD's run, top)
//            Lo = {s-1, cH}          two-ended  herring (extends cH's run, bottom)
//            H  = {s+L, cH}          two-ended  herring (extends cH's run, top)
//            kColour supports at s, s+1 (cH's low run pulls cH from there) and
//            at s+L-3 (cC's run pulls cC from there)
//   goal   : run cD {s+L-2 .. s+L}      <- D's genuine home
//            run cH {s-1 .. s+1}        <- Lo's genuine home
//            run cH {s+L-2 .. s+L}      <- H's genuine home
//            run cC {s+L-3 .. s+L-1}    <- the run-only zone's third leg
//            one group per value s..s+L-3, colours per pullsAt() below
//
// THE COUPLING (why this is a chain, not two puzzles sharing a grid): cC's run
// {s+L-3..s+L-1} exists ONLY because cD and cH both vacate the high end. Take
// away either trap's short run and cC's tiles at those values need a group that
// no longer has three colours. So the two traps are load-bearing for each other
// through a single shared reorganisation of the high end — and, measured in the
// harness, resolving one correctly leaves the other's obvious move still a
// provable dead end (solveBag on the reduced bag), so no trap is defused by
// progress on the other.
//
// L >= 6 (measured): at L=5 the three kColour supports land on s, s+1, s+2 —
// three consecutive, a valid run on their own, breaking invariant (c) — and the
// decoy append is not yet a dead end. Verified directly in composed.verify.ts.
